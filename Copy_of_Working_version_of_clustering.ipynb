        "\n",
        "Up until now we have been focusing on supervised learning. In supervised learning our training set consists of labeled data. For example, we have images and each image has an associated  label: dog, cat, elephant. And from this labeled data our model is trying to learn how to predict the label from the features. \n",
        "\n",
        "Unsupervised learning is trying to learn patterns from unlabeled data, and one set of models has to do with segmenting a dataset into clusters or groups of related data.\n",

        "\n",
        "### k-means clustering\n",
        "For one type, we tell the algorithm how many clusters to make. Please cluster these 1,000\n",
        "people into 5 groups. Please classify these web pages into 15 groups. These methods go by\n",
        "the name of k-means clustering algorithms and we will discuss those a bit later.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### hierarchical clustering\n",
        "For the other approach we don’t specify how many clusters to make. Instead the algorithm\n",
        "starts with each instance in its own cluster. At each iteration of the algorithm it combines the\n",
        "two most similar clusters into one. It repeatedly does this until there is only one cluster. This is called hierarchical clustering and its name makes sense. The running of the algorithm\n",
        "results in one cluster, which consists of two sub-clusters. Each of those two sub-clusters in\n",
